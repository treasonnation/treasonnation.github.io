There are too many problems to explore in this manifesto, so our attention will be directed at our overt enemies and their actions to crush our existence, thereby stopping any attempt in revolutionary growth and progress here in Amerika.

Feel me! Ladies and gentlemen, comrades and cadets, homies, cuzins, guerillas, wolves, kings, queens, and civilians; whatever y’all go by I salute all of you equally who live and die by what you represent, not just outwardly but inward as well; and that goes for all the principles laid down by all our founding fathers and the growth and changes they have made. From this standpoint I salute all my G’s and progressive people around the world, nationally and here in the belly of the beast where I currently dwell; now feel me!

Stay tuned for more to come from the _Gangism Manifesto_.

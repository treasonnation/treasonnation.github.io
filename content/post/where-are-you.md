They used to call her strong,  
Today that is no longer right, it’s wrong

At one time she was our foundation to our home; Now, she feels like our funny bone

She guided thousands of us to freedom in the North; Now, look at the grown Black Girl Lost,  
V.I.P. to pay the cost

Used to speak Sojurner’s truth, today, both lips are loose;

She refused to sit at the back of the bus, Now, she’ll strip and lap-dance for a buck;

She sung I’m Black and I’m Proud for the Cause, Now, she struts around with no draws;

**OH BLACK WOMAN WHERE HAVE YOU GONE,  
AND HOW IN THE HELL CAN I BRING YOU BACK HOME??**

So you wanna know where I’ve been? Out here in the city of sin

While you were lifting weights in the pen,  
I was out here figuring out how to feed him

Once what you left was spent,  
how in the hell was I supposed to pay the rent, phone, lights, heat, and visit?

Shall we not forget you left me with a few habits?

ONE was getting Dick,  
TWO was getting high and twisted,  
THREE was wearin’ the flyest shit,  
FOUR was the car note for this pretty ass whip, FIVE was rockin’ ice on my neck, ankle and wrist.

So while you’re gettin’ educated, three hots and a cot for free, remember you live or die,  
starve or survive,

based on money!

**OH BLACK MAN IN THAT CAGE  
FILLED WITH SO MUCH RAGE  
WHEN WILL YOU BREAK FREE AND TAKE AWAY THIS PAIN?**
